Kubernetes is like a cluster. In Cluster there are so many nodes.
Docker dont have capabilities of Hosts, Auto Scaling, Auto Healing, Enterprise Nature But Kubernetes has all of that.

## Introduction

Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It allows you to manage containerized applications across a cluster of machines efficiently.

**Why Learn Kubernetes?**
- **Scalability:** Automatically scale applications based on demand.
- **Resilience:** Self-healing mechanisms for container failures.
- **Portability:** Run applications on-premises or in the cloud.
- **Community & Ecosystem:** A robust ecosystem with many tools and integrations.

## Basics of Kubernetes

### What is Kubernetes?
- **Definition:** An orchestration platform for managing containerized applications.
- **Key Components:**  
  - **Master/Control Plane:** Manages the cluster state and scheduling.
  - **Nodes:** Machines that run your containerized applications.
  - **Pods:** The smallest deployable units, a group of one or more containers.
  - **Services:** Expose your pods to internal or external traffic.
  - **ConfigMaps & Secrets:** Manage configuration and sensitive data.

### Core Concepts
- **Containers vs. Virtual Machines:** Containers share the host OS, making them lightweight.
- **Pods:** A pod can contain one or multiple containers that share the same network namespace.
- **ReplicaSets & Deployments:** Ensure the desired number of pod replicas are running.
- **Services:** Types include ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.

### Setting Up Your Environment
- **Minikube:** A tool that lets you run a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally.
  - **Installation:** Follow [Minikube’s documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) for your OS.
- **kubectl:** The command-line tool for interacting with the cluster.
  - **Installation:** See [kubectl docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

### Exercises
1. **Install Minikube & kubectl:**  
   - Exercise: Set up Minikube and verify by running `kubectl get nodes`.
2. **Create Your First Pod:**  
   - Create a YAML file for a simple Nginx pod.
   - Example YAML:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: nginx-pod
     spec:
       containers:
       - name: nginx
         image: nginx:latest
         ports:
         - containerPort: 80
     ```
   - Run: `kubectl apply -f your-pod.yaml`  
   - Verify: `kubectl get pods`

---

## Intermediate Kubernetes Concepts

### Deployments, Scaling & Updates
- **Deployments:** Manage stateless applications.
  - **Exercise:** Create a deployment for an Nginx server.
  - Example command: `kubectl create deployment nginx-deployment --image=nginx`
- **Scaling:**  
  - Command: `kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=3`
- **Rolling Updates:**  
  - Update your deployment with a new image and observe a rolling update.
  - Command: `kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.19`

### Networking & Services
- **Services:**  
  - Expose your deployment using a ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer.
  - Example YAML for a NodePort service:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: nginx-service
    spec:
      type: NodePort
      selector:
        app: nginx
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 80
          nodePort: 30007
    ```
- **Ingress Controllers:**  
  - Used for advanced routing, SSL termination, and domain-based routing.

### Storage & Configurations
- **Persistent Volumes & Claims:** Manage stateful applications.
- **ConfigMaps & Secrets:** Manage configuration data and sensitive information.
  - Exercise: Create a ConfigMap to store environment variables and use it in a pod.

### Exercises
1. **Deploy a Multi-Tier Application:**  
   - Create a backend (e.g., a database) and a frontend (e.g., a web app) and connect them using services.
2. **Update Deployment Strategy:**  
   - Experiment with rolling updates and rollbacks.
3. **Network Policies:**  
   - Define simple network policies to restrict traffic between pods.

## Advanced Kubernetes Concepts

### Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) & Operators
- **CRDs:** Extend Kubernetes API with your own resource types.
- **Operators:** Automate the management of complex applications on Kubernetes.
  - Exercise: Explore a simple operator (such as the [etcd operator](https://github.com/coreos/etcd-operator)).

### Service Mesh & Ingress Controllers
- **Service Mesh:** (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) for advanced traffic management, security, and observability.
- **Advanced Ingress:** Implement rules for traffic routing and SSL management.

### Security, Monitoring, and Logging
- **Security:**  
  - Best practices for RBAC, Secrets management, and network policies.
  - Common pitfalls: Overly permissive policies.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, and Kubernetes metrics-server.
  - Exercise: Set up Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your cluster.
- **Logging:**  
  - Integrate logging solutions such as EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana).

### Exercises
1. **Build an Operator:**  
   - Try creating a basic operator using the Operator SDK.
2. **Implement a Service Mesh:**  
   - Deploy Istio on your cluster and configure traffic splitting.
3. **Enhance Security:**  
   - Configure RBAC roles and test access control.

## Common Mistakes and Best Practices

### Common Mistakes
- **Incorrect YAML Syntax:**  
  - Use YAML linters and validation tools.
- **Ignoring Resource Requests & Limits:**  
  - Always set requests and limits to avoid resource contention.
- **Overly Broad RBAC Policies:**  
  - Apply the principle of least privilege.
- **Not Monitoring Cluster Health:**  
  - Set up proper logging and monitoring early on.

### Best Practices
- **Version Control for Configurations:**  
  - Store your YAML files in Git.
- **Infrastructure as Code:**  
  - Use tools like Terraform and Helm for repeatable deployments.
- **Regularly Update Your Cluster:**  
  - Keep up with the latest Kubernetes releases and security patches.
- **Document Everything:**  
  - Maintain clear documentation of your deployments and configurations.
